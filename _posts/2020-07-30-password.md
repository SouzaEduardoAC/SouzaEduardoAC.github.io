Let's talk about **passwords**. 
We already know that passwords have levels of strength but... is that enough?

As developers we must think a little deeper.
In a data level, we have database encryption, such as row level / table level that can protect our data, but even that can be broken into.
> * SQL Injection can retrieve data from a encrypted database since it uses the application to perform the attack
