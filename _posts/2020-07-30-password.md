Let's talk about **passwords**. 
We already know that passwords have levels of strength but... is that enough?

As developers we must think a little deeper.
In a data level, we have database encryption, such as row level / table level that can protect our data, but even that can be broken into.

There also has a few points to consider about password:
 * Passwords encrypted with the same key can have identical ciphertext
 * The encryption key **must** be stored outside of the database

As a matter of attention, attacker also try to use a _rainbow table_.

A known method to deal with rainbow table is to hash a password with a salt.
> **Salt** is a randomly generated value that is added (prefix, sufix or both) to the password prior to hashing
> * It is not a secret value and should be stored next to the password as plain text
> * Each password should be hashed with its own unique salt. When that happends, rainbow table needs to recompute for each password + salt pair which increases the total computation time and decreases password cracking speed

There are a few known good ways to hash a password securely, using **KDFs (Key Derivation Function)**
 * bcrypt
 * PBKDF2
 * scrypt
 * ARGON2

Properly implemented and configured, KDF effectively protects the stored password against attacks but it should be balanced to not affect UX and performance.

There is also a client side hashing that is a huge problem. Client side hashing leads to pass-hash attack.

## How to save the password securely

1. After the user creates the password, it is transmitted in plaintext over a secure channel (TLS) to the server
2. Hash using KDF and store in database
   * User enumeration attack and MITM attack during the data transfer from the application to the database should be considered when creating the authentication functionality

## How to validate password properly

1. After the user enters the username and the password, the plain text pair is transmitted over a secure channel to the server
2. The server hashes the password using KDF and then looks for the username/KDF(password) pair in the database
